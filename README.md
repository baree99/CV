## Peter Barcsak

As you read through my CV, you might wonder how I ended up deciding to change my life and study web development. You may think I'm completely new to it, but looking back, in all of my previous jobs I've learnt skills which I now use in programming every day. How to solve problems via innovating systems, how to communicate effectively, how to be a team player, how to have an eye for detail, and how to always be a better and more knowledgeable person than I was the day before.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

At RoCHe, we often had issues with identifying who had been approached by different team members for the same role. I created a shared resourcing spreadsheet to be able to follow up on contacted candidates in real time.

#### Effective Communication

As a Shift Leader I was responsible for a team of 10-12 employees. Communication was key to informing everyone about recent changes during service time.

#### Team Player

My favourite sport is football. I've played it since I was a little kid. In football, a team always have to share the same goal. You need to know your teammates strengths and weaknesses, to be able to ask for help when needed, and help others out. I believe this is a skill I can use in any environment.

#### Eye for Detail

During my time at Pedal Pedal, I tested the development website to ensure the company’s standards for functionality and User Experience were met.
