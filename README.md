## Peter Barcsak

As you read through my CV you might wonder how did I ended up studying Web Development to change my life. You may think I am completely new to it, but looking back, all in my previous jobs I learnt parts of it. How to solve problems via innovating systems, how to communicate effectively, how to be a team player, how to have an eye for detail and how to be a better and more knowledgeable person than I was the day before.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving
At RoCHe we often had issue with identifying who had been approached by the different team members for the same role. I created a shared resourcing spreadsheet to be able to follow up on contacted candidates real time.

#### Effective communication
As a Shift Leader I was responsible for a team of 10-12 employees. Communication was the key to inform everyone about recent changes during service time.

#### Team player
My favourite sport is football. I am playing it since I was a little kid. In football, a team always have to share the same goal. You need to know your teammates strength and weaknesses. Ask for help when needed and help others out. I believe this is a skill I can use in any environment.

#### Eye for Detail
During my time at Pedal Pedal, I tested the development website to ensure the company’s standards for functionality and User Experience are met.
