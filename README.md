## Peter Barcsak

I believe our life is a journey where we cross other people's journeys in certain places, we learn from them, challenge each other and when the time comes we move on. I have been lucky so far as I had the chance to work with some outstading professionals in different kind of businesses who loved what they do. There was always only one problem: I wasn't able to imagane myself working in that business for the rest of my life. Fortunately, in every problem there is an opportunity. I decided to take on a more challenging path then I ever faced before. Combining what I already know, gaining some useful new skills, what can be a strong base for my future. To do something I love: creating new systems while collaborating with other people to reach goals. I made the first step when I enrolled to Makers Academy's Web Development course and here I am now, after 16 weeks of intensive training, looking for a place to further develop my new skills.
